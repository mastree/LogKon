## How to run this game?

### On Linux (preferably Ubuntu)
It's been tested and worked perfectly on GNU Prolog 1.4.5 (64 bits).

To compile and run all of the files, the only thing you need to type in your terminal is
  ```
  gplc start-help.pl
  ```
After that, you can run the compiled binary file using command
  ```
  ./start-help
  ```
  
### On Windows
It's been tested and worked perfectly on GNU Prolog 1.4.5 (64 bits).

To compile and run all of the files, you need to open the GNU Prolog console first.
Then, consult the start-help.pl file.





**This is for all OS**
After you have successfully consulted it, to run it, please type in
```
?- init_game.
```
first. Then you'll see the intro to the game.

That's all you have to do!
