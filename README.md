## How to run this game?

### On Linux (preferably Ubuntu)
It's been tested and worked perfectly on GNU Prolog 1.4.5 (64 bits).

To compile and run all of the files, the only thing you need to type in your terminal is
  ```
  gplc start-help.pl
  ```
After that, you can run the compiled binary file using command
  ```
  ./start-help
  ```
  
### On Windows

That's all you have to do!
